# Collegiate Consulting Group - Website
## Broad Overview:
The Brown Collegiate Consulting website can be found at www.brownccg.com
<br>
To view these files locally and visualize edits, simply git clone and open index.html either from the directory or with live server.

## Maintenance and Future Development:
This website was built by hand, making use of the Bootstrap CSS library. As such, 
while it may not be as no-code friendly as a static site generator like Wix or Weebly, 
low levels of technical exxpertise are required to update it. For comprehensive details on updating things
such as:
- Consultant photos and bios
- Events and announcements
- Recruiting information
<br>
Please refer to the private technical documentation (owned by CCG president)
